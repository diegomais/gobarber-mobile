## :seat: Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) before following the instructions below.

### Setting up the development environment

The following steps need to be performed inside a terminal window (Windows user may prefer to use the [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/windowsterminal) but the Command Prompt will also work).

Clone the repository and build Docker images:

```shell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/diegomais/gobarber-ts.git

# Change directory
cd gobarber-ts

# Build Docker images
docker-compose build

# Create .env from example file
if [ ! -f $PWD/backend/.env ]; then cp $PWD/backend/.env.example $PWD/backend/.env; fi

# Apply database migrations
docker-compose run --rm backend yarn typeorm migration:run
```

### Running application containers

Use the following command to run all GoBarber containers (from within the gobarber-ts directory):

```shell
# Start containers
docker-compose up
```

### Mobile

#### Prerequisites

The project can be built with npm or Yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- **npm** is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **Yarn** is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general. [Download Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

#### Setting up the development environment

Follow the instructions for React Native CLI available in the official [React Native Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

#### Installing dependencies and running the mobile application

Run the instructions bellow inside `mobile` directory:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

or

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```
